This is my implementation of a simple UDP web server for Uvic's Networking course. To run, type the command ./sws <portnumber> <serving dir>. To exit the web server press the key 'q'.


TESTING:

To test the program, run the command make test ... and then run the test file ./Testfile.sh ...

The cooresponding expected output is as follows

HTTP/1.0 200 OK; followed by the contents of indext.html
HTTP/1.0 404 Not Found; followed by no content
HTTP/1.0 400 Bad Request; followed by no content
HTTP/1.0 400 Bad Request; followed by no content
HTTP/1.0 404 Not Found; followed by no content


CODE STRUCTURE:

My approach with the assignment was to ... 

1. First bind the socket that my server would listen on
2. Handle any request for information with the request_handle function
3. Parse and check the each individual token in the request to see if it is valid
4. After determining the request is valid, I then pass the necessary information to my build_response function
5. In build_response I build the response buffer and send it back to the client
